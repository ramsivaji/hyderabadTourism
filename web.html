              Predating the Charminar, built by the Kakatiyas Dynasty in the 13th century, Golkonda witnessed reigns of many dynasties over the history—from Bahmani, Qutub Shahis, to even Mugal regimes. Constructed on a granite hill, the citadel is a true reflection of ancient architecture and engineering. The most appealing feature of the monument is it's acoustic: The monument resonates sounds through the wall right from the entrance, Fateh Darwaza, to the highest point, Bala Hissar. Golkonda is one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad. Witness the rich and instructive history lively resting in the rocks of the monument.
